This is a messy script that uses the Binary Ninja API to scrape out a function (and any functions that it may call), and place it in a text file, which can /almost/ be compiled and ran... Just needs the recontruction of the values passed to the original function (I believe..), also any fixed memory addresses are going to be very messed up. this could be expanded on and be made to be a lot better, but this was all I needed for a little hack a while back.
